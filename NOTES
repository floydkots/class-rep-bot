1. Check for group or private chats
2. Check for which group is going on.
3. Encourage the user through the answers.
4. Limit the number of commands.

I noticed that after deploying:
  - Registration failed because I had not set up a single
    student class as admin. I wounder if there might
    be a better way to go about it.
  - In a group chat, you cannot request a phone number. So,
    registration chat must be private.
